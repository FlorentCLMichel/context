%C This module is part of the \CONTEXT\ macro||package and is
%C therefore copyrighted by \PRAGMA. Non||commercial use is 
%C granted. 

%D We've build \CONTEXT\ on top of \PLAIN\ \TEX. Because we 
%D want to make the format file as independant as possible of 
%D machine dependant font encodings, we have to bypass the 
%D loading of fonts. 
%D 
%D Let's start at the beginning. Because \PLAIN\ is not yet
%D loaded we have to define some \CATCODES\ ourselves. 

\catcode`\{=1 % left brace is begin-group character
\catcode`\}=2 % right brace is end-group character
\catcode`\#=6 % hash mark is macro parameter character

%D We are going to report to the user what we are skipping.

\def\skipmessage#1{\immediate\write16{skipping #1 in plain}} 

%D We want to be able to use the \type{\newsomething}
%D declarations not only on the \type{\outer} level. This can
%D be done by redefining \type{\outer} so we have to save its
%D original meaning. 

\let\normalouter = \outer       
\let\outer       = \relax

%D We also want to postpone the loading of hyphenation patters,
%D so we redefine and therefore save \type{\input}. 

\let\normalinput = \input  
\def\input       #1 {\skipmessage{\string\input}}

%D Finaly are going to we redefine some font specification 
%D commands and that's why we save them too. The redefinitions
%D are straightforward because the macros have to do nothing 
%D but skipping.

\let\normalskewchar         = \skewchar
\def\skewchar               #1=#2 {\skipmessage{\string\skewchar}}

\let\normaltextfont         = \textfont
\let\normalscriptfont       = \scriptfont
\let\normalscriptscriptfont = \scriptscriptfont

\def\textfont               #1=#2{\skipmessage{\string\textfont}}
\def\scriptfont             #1=#2{\skipmessage{\string\scriptfont}}
\def\scriptscriptfont       #1=#2{\skipmessage{\string\scriptscriptfont}}

%D The redefinition of \type{\font} is a bit more complicated, 
%D because in version 3.14159 a scaled specification was 
%D introduced. 

\let\normalfont = \font

\def\skipscaled scaled #1 {}

\long\def\font#1=#2 #3%
  {\ifx#3s%
     \skipmessage{scaled \string\font}%
     \let\next=\skipscaled
   \else
     \skipmessage{\string\font}%
     \let\next=\relax
   \fi
   \next#3}

%D Relaxing some font switching macros is needed because we 
%D don't want any error messages during loading. These 
%D unharmfull messages could be ingored. 
%D
%D The next substitution is needed for determining 
%D \type{\p@renwd} in the macro \type{\bordermatrix}. 

\def\tenex#1%
  {\skipmessage{used \string\tenex}\hskip8.75002pt} 

%D We need to define \type{\tenrm} for switching to 
%D \type{\rm}. 

\def\tenrm%
  {\skipmessage{\string\tenrm}} 

%D In \CONTEXT\ all \PLAIN\ \TEX\ fonts are available, just 
%D like \type{\p@renwd}. We only postpone loading them until
%D they are actually needed.

%D By bypassing fonts, some definitions become less valid so 
%D we have to redefine them afterwards. 
%D 
%D \starttypen
%D \let\normalbordermatrix=\bordermatrix
%D 
%D \def\bordermatrix%
%D   {\bgroup
%D    \setbox0=\hbox{\getvalue{\textface\c!mm\c!ex}B}%
%D    \global\p@renwd=\wd0\relax
%D    \egroup
%D    \normalbordermatrix}
%D \stoptypen

%D Now we are ready for loading \PLAIN\ \TEX. Of couse we use 
%D \type{\normalinput} and not \type{\input}.

\normalinput plain.tex

%D We have to take care of unwanted \PDFTEX\ 
%D initializations. We just want to default to \DVI\ output. 

\ifx\pdftexversion\undefined 
  \chardef\pdfoutput=0 
\else
  \pdfoutput=0
\fi 

%D When applicable, we also load the \ETEX\ source and 
%D defintion files. 

\def\gobbleETEX#1\par{}
\def\doifETEX{\ifx\eTeXversion\undefined     \expandafter\gobbleETEX\fi}
\def\ifnoETEX{\ifx\eTeXversion\undefined\else\expandafter\gobbleETEX\fi}

\doifETEX \normalinput     etex.src \relax 
\doifETEX \normalinput etexdefs.lib \relax 

\let\normalprotected  = \protected
\let\normalunexpanded = \unexpanded

%D We restore some redefined primitives to their old meaning. 

\let\font             = \normalfont
\let\skewchar         = \normalskewchar
\let\textfont         = \normaltextfont
\let\scriptfont       = \normalscriptfont
\let\scriptscriptfont = \normalscriptscriptfont
\let\input            = \normalinput
\let\outer            = \normalouter

%D We reset some of the used auxiliary macro's to 
%D \type{\undefined}. One never knows what testing on them is
%D done elsewhere. 

\let\skipmessage            = \undefined
\let\skipscaled             = \undefined
\let\normalfont             = \undefined
\let\normalskewchar         = \undefined
\let\normaltextfont         = \undefined
\let\normalscriptfont       = \undefined
\let\normalscriptscriptfont = \undefined
\let\normalinput            = \undefined
\let\normalouter            = \undefined

%D We want a bit more statistics and some less logging info 
%D in the \type{log} file.
