% NOT YET ADAPTED TO THE NEW FONT MACROS

%D This module is build on top of \ARABTEX\ and arabic
%D support. I dedicate this module to my father Hein Hagen,
%D who did not live long enough to become a user. His huge
%D library contains math, science, history, english literature,
%D philisophy and theology books, but his most favoured ones
%D were those traditional hebrew printings. I must admit
%D that some of those make clear that traditonal typesetting
%D can still beat \TEX. Those nested multicolumn documents with
%D complicated can give even the experienced macro writer a
%D rather persistent headache.
