\writestatus{loading}{Context Font Macros / Hebrew (ArabTeX) support}

%D This module is build on top of \ARABTEX\ and arabic 
%D support. I dedicate this module to my father Hein Hagen, 
%D who did not live long enough to become a user. His huge  
%D library contains math, science, history, english literature, 
%D philisophy and theology books, but his most favoured ones 
%D were those traditional hebrew printings. I must admit 
%D that some of those make clear that traditonal typesetting 
%D can still beat \TEX. Those nested multicolumn documents with 
%D complicated can give even the experienced macro writer a 
%D rather persistent headache.
