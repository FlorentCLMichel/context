%D The macros in this module are rather old and were originally
%D part of the figure inclusion macros. When \PDFTEX\ started
%D to support \PDF\ inclusion, where some accompanying macros
%D were put in \type{supp-pdf}, I considered it more suitable
%D to give the \EPS\ macros their own module.

%D
%D The predecessors of the following macro's are derived from 
%D Thomas Rockicky's macro's. They are rewritten to a more 
%D compact form, made a bit more robust and also handle the 
%D \type{HiResBoundingBox} and \type{ExactBoundingBox} that 
%D are sometimes present.
%D
%D A bounding box has the form: 
%D
%D \starttypen
%D %%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury 
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D Before we scan the file, we have to reset special 
%D characters and set some others. The percentage symbol also 
%D needs special treatment. When a bounding box is 
%D encountered, we keep on scanning until no more directives 
%D are found, i.e. a line is found that does not start with a 
%D percentage symbol. We also abort scanning after finding a 
%D high resolution bounding box. 
%D
%D This method also works inside verbatim mode (like when we 
%D are typesetting sources and putting eps coded logos into 
%D a heading. Temporary restoring the \CATCODES\ is done in 
%D the calling routine.
