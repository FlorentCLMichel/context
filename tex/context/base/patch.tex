In this file the most important changes are reported. Some changes will 
go unnoticed, others do influence the results slightly and/or solve real
bugs. Changes to mechanisms under construction or revision are reported
in the documentation or not mentioned at all. I'm quite sure that I 
forget to mention many patches.

 1 mai 1998: depth of \underbar limited to \dp\strutbox, prevent unequal 
             baseline distances 
 3 mai 1998: \splittopskip settings added in supp-box routines, else 
             funny baselinedistances in numbered/underbared paragraphs  
 3 mai 1998: \parskip corrections added in shapebox routines, else empty
             lines at top of (some) page(s)
 5 mai 1998: the quote optimizations didn't work out all right in fonts 
             other than the CMR ones, therefore we revert to the default
             ligatures  
 6 mai 1998: missing references were already turned into fake ones (to 
             prevent further messages) but testing is more strict now
