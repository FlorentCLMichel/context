%D Verbatim typesetting, especially of \TEX\ sources, is a
%D non||trivial task. This is a direct results of the fact that
%D characters can have \CATCODES\ other than~11 and such
%D characters needs a special treatment. What for instance is
%D \TEX\ supposed to do when it encounters a \type{$} or an
%D \type{#}? This module deals with these matters.

\writestatus{loading}{Context Support Macros / Verbatim}

%D The verbatim environment has some features, like coloring
%D \TEX\ text, seldom found in other environments. Especially
%D when the output of \TEX\ is viewed on an electronic medium,
%D coloring has a positive influence on the readability of
%D \TEX\ sources, so we found it very acceptable to dedicate
%D half of this module to typesetting \TEX\ specific character
%D sequences in color. In this module we'll also present some
%D macro's for typesetting inline, display and file verbatim.
%D The macro's are capable of handling \TAB\ too.
%D
%D This module shows a few tricks that are often overseen by
%D novice, like the use of the \TEX\ primitive \type{\meaning}.
%D First I'll show in what way the users are confronted with
%D verbatim typesetting. Because we want to be able to test for
%D symmetry and because we hate the method of closing down the
%D verbatim mode with some strange active character, we will
%D use the following construction for display verbatim:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \starttyping
%D The Dutch word 'typen' stands for 'typing', therefore in the Dutch version
%D one will not find the word 'verbatim'.
%D \stoptyping
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D In \CONTEXT\ files can be typed with \type{\typefile} and
%D inline verbatim can be accomplished with \type{\type}. This
%D last command comes in many flavors:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D We can say \type<<something>> or \type{something}. The first one is a bit
%D longer but also supports slanted typing, which accomplished by typing
%D \type<<a <<slanted>> word>>. We can also use commands to enhance the text
%D \type<<with <</bf boldfaced>> text>>. Just to be complete, we decided
%D to accept also \LaTeX\ alike verbatim, which means that \type+something+
%D and \type|something| are valid commands too. Of course we want the grouped
%D alternatives to process \type{hello {\bf big} world}} with braces.
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D In the core modules, we will build this support on top of
%D this module. There these commands can be tuned with
%D accompanying setup commands. There we can enable commands,
%D slanted typing, control spaces, \TAB||handling and (here we
%D are:) coloring. We can also setup surrounding white space
%D and indenting. Here we'll only show some examples.

\unprotect

%D \macros
%D   {verbatimfont}
%D   {}
%D
%D When we are typesetting verbatim we use a non||proportional
%D (mono spaced) font. Normally this font is available by
%D calling \type{\tt}. In \CONTEXT\ this command does a
%D complete font||style switch. There we could have stuck with
%D \type{\tttf}.

\ifx \undefined \verbatimfont \def\verbatimfont {\tt} \fi

%D \macros
%D   {obeyedspace, obeyedtab, obeyedline, obeyedpage}
%D   {}
%D
%D We have followed Knuth in naming macros that make \SPACE,
%D \NEWLINE\ and \NEWPAGE\ active and assigning them
%D \type{\obeysomething}, but first we set some default values.

\def\obeyedspace {\hbox{ }}
\def\obeyedtab   {\obeyedspace}
\def\obeyedline  {\par}
\def\obeyedpage  {\vfill\eject}

%D \macros
%D   {controlspace,setcontrolspaces}
%D   {}
%D
%D First we define \type{\obeyspaces}. When we want visible
%D spaces (control spaces) we only have to adapt the definition
%D of \type{\obeyedspace} to:

\def\controlspace {\hbox{\char32}}

\bgroup
\catcode`\ =\@@active
\gdef\obeyspaces{\catcode`\ =\@@active\def {\obeyedspace}}
\gdef\setcontrolspaces{\catcode`\ =\@@active\def {\controlspace}}
\egroup

%D \macros
%D   {obeytabs, obeylines, obeypages,
%D    ignoretabs, ignorelines, ignorepages}
%D   {}
%D
%D Next we take care of \NEWLINE\ and \NEWPAGE\ and because we
%D want to be able to typeset listings that contain \TAB, we
%D have to handle those too. Because we have to redefine the
%D \NEWPAGE\ character locally, we redefine the meaning of
%D this (often already) active character.

%D enable us to implement character||specific behavior, like 
%D colored verbatim.

%D \macros
%D   {settabskips}
%D   {}
%D
%D The macro \type{\settabskip} can be used to enable tab 
%D handling. Processing tabs is sometimes needed when one 
%D processes a plain \ASCII\ listing. Tab handling slows down 
%D verbatim typesetting considerably.

%D
%D Although the inline verbatim commands presented here will be
%D extended and embedded in the core modules of \CONTEXT,
%D they can be used separately. Both grouped and character
%D alternatives are provided but \type{<<} and nested
%D braces are implemented in the core module. This commands
%D takes one argument: the closing command.
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \processinlineverbatim{\closingcommand}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D One can define his own verbatim commands, which can be very
%D simple:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\Verbatim {\processinlineverbatim\relax}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D or a bit more more complex:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\GroupedVerbatim%
%D   {\bgroup
%D    \dosomeusefullthings
%D    \processinlineverbatim\egroup}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D Before entering inline verbatim mode, we take care of the
%D unwanted \TAB, \NEWLINE\ and \NEWPAGE\ characters and
%D turn them into \SPACE. We need the double \type{\bgroup}
%D construction to keep the closing command local.

%D
%D The closing command is executed afterwards as an internal
%D command and therefore should not be given explicitly when
%D typesetting inline verbatim.
%D
%D We can define a display verbatim environment with the
%D command \type{\processdisplayverbatim} in the following way:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \processdisplayverbatim{\closingcommand}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D \noindent For instance, we can define a simple command like:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\BeginVerbatim {\processdisplayverbatim{EndVerbatim}}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D \noindent But we can also do more advance things like:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\BeginVerbatim {\bigskip \processdisplayverbatim{\EndVerbatim}}
%D \def\EndVerbatim   {\bigskip}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D When we compare these examples, we see that the backslash in
%D the closing command is optional. One is free in actually
%D defining a closing command. If one is defined, the command
%D is executed after ending verbatim mode.

%D We save the closing sequence in \type{\endofverbatimcommand}

%D \type{\parskip}, because we don't want inter||paragraph
%D skips to creep into the verbatim source. Furthermore we
%D \type{\relax} the line||processing macro while getting the
%D rest of the first line. The initialization command
%D \type{\setupcopyverbatim} does just what we expect it to do:
%D it assigns all characters \CATCODE~11. Next we switch to

%D needed, which can be in the mid of typesetting verbatim. 
%D However, when reading in data in verbatim mode, we should 
%D temporary restore the normal \CATCODES, and that's exactly

%D \TEX\ does not offer \type{\everyline}, which is a direct
%D result of its advanced multi||pass paragraph typesetting
%D mechanism. Because in verbatim mode paragraphs and lines are
%D more or less equal, we can easily implement our own simple
%D \type{\everyline} support.

%D \macros

%D
%D In this module we've reserved \type{\everypar} for the
%D things to be done with paragraphs and \type{\everyline} for
%D line specific actions. In \CONTEXT\ however, we use
%D \type{\everypar} for placing side- and columnfloats,
%D inhibiting indentation and some other purposes. In verbatim
%D mode, every line becomes a paragraph, which means that
%D \type{\everypar} is executed frequently. To be sure, the
%D user specific use of both \type{\everyline} and
%D \type{\everypar} is implemented by means of
%D \type{\EveryLine} and \type{\EveryPar}.
%D
%D We still have to take care of the \TAB. A \TAB\ takes eight
%D spaces and a \SPACE\ normally has a width of 0.5~em. Because
%D we can be halfway a tabulation, we must keep track of the
%D position. This takes time, especially when we print complete
%D files, therefore we \type{\relax} this mechanism by default.

%D One can use the different \type{\obeysomething} commands to
%D influence the behavior of these macro's. We use for instance
%D \type{\obeycharacters} for making \type{/} an active
%D character when we want to include typesetting commands.
%D
%D We'll spend the remainder of this article on coloring the
%D verbatim text. At \PRAGMA\ we use the integrated environment
%D \TEXEDIT\ for editing and processing \TEX\
%D documents.\voetnoot{\TEXEDIT\ has been operative since
%D 1991.} This program also supports real time spell checking
%D and \TEX\ based file management. Although definitely not
%D exclusive, the programs cooperate nicely with \CONTEXT.
%D Because \TEX\ can be considered a tool for experts, we've
%D tried to put as less a burden on non||technical users as
%D possible. This is accomplished in the following ways:
%D
%D \startopsomming
%D
%D \som  We've added some trivial symmetry checking to
%D       \TEXEDIT. Sources are checked for the use of brackets,
%D       braces, begin||end and start||stop like constructions,
%D       with or without arguments.
%D
%D \som  Although \TEX\ is very tolerant to unformatted input,
%D       we stimulate users to make the \ASCII\ source as clean
%D       as possible. Many sources I've seen in distribution
%D       sets look so awful, that I sometimes wonder how people
%D       get them working. In our opinion, a good||looking
%D       source leads to less errors.
%D
%D \som  We use parameter driven setups and make the commands
%D       as tolerant as possible. We don't accept commands that
%D       don't look nice in \ASCII.
%D
%D \som  Finally ---I could have added some more--- we use
%D       color.
%D
%D \stopopsomming
%D
%D When in spell||checking||mode, the words spelled correctly
%D are shown in {\em green}, the unknown or wrongly spelled
%D words are in {\em red} and upto four categories of words,
%D for instance passive verbs and nouns, become {\em blue}
%D (or cyan) or {\em yellow}. Short and nearly always correct
%D words are in white (on a black screen). This makes
%D checking||on||the||fly very easy and convenient, especially
%D because we place the accents automatically.
%D
%D In \TEX||mode we show \TEX||specific tokens and sequences of
%D tokens in appropriate colors and again we use four colors.
%D We use those colors in a way that supports parameter driven
%D setups, table typesetting and easy visual checking of
%D symmetry. Furthermore the text becomes more readable.

%D Macro||definition and style files often look quite green,
%D because they contain many calls to macros. Pure text files
%D on the other hand are mostly white (on the screen) and color
%D clearly shows their structure.
%D
%D When I prepared the interactive \PDF\ manuals of \CONTEXT,
%D \TEXEDIT\ and \PPCHTEX\ (1995), I decided to include the
%D original source text of the manuals as an appendix. At every
%D chapter or (sub)section the reader can go to the
%D corresponding line in the source, just to see how things
%D were done in \TEX. Of course, the reader can jump from the
%D to corresponding typeset text too.
%D
%D Confronted with those long (boring) sources, I decided that
%D a colored output, in accordance with \TEXEDIT\ would be
%D nice. It would not only visually add some quality to the
%D manual, but also make the sources more readable.
%D
%D Apart from a lot of \CATCODE||magic, programming the color
%D macros was surprisingly easy. Although the macro's are
%D hooked into the standard \CONTEXT\ verbatim mechanism, they
%D are set up in a way that embedding them in another verbatim
%D environment is possible.
%D
%D We can turn on coloring by reassigning
%D \type{\obeycharacters}:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \let\obeycharacters=\setupprettytextype
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D During pretty typesetting we can be in two states: {\em
%D command} and {\em parameter}. The first condition becomes
%D true if we encounter a backslash, the second state is
%D entered when we meet a~\type{#}.

\newif\ifintexcommand
\newif\ifintexparameter

%D \macros
%D   {splittexparameters}
%D   {}
%D
%D The mechanism described here, is meant to be used with
%D color. It is nevertheless possible to use different fonts
%D instead of distinctive colors. When using color, it's better
%D to end parameter mode after the \type{#}. When on the
%D other hand we use a slanted typeface for the hashmark, then
%D a slanted number looks better.

\newif\ifsplittexparameters   \splittexparameterstrue

%D \macros
%D   {splittexcontrols}
%D   {}
%D
%D With \type{\splittexcontrols} we can influence the way
%D control characters are processed in macro names. By default,
%D the \type{^^} part is uncolored. When this boolean is set to
%D false, they get the same color as the other characters.

\newif\ifsplittexcontrols     \splittexcontrolstrue

%D The next boolean is used for internal purposes only and
%D keeps track of the length of the name. Because two||character
%D sequences starting with a backslash are always seen as a
%D command.

\newif\iffirstintexcommand

%D We use a maximum of four colors because more colors will
%D distract too much. In the following table we show the
%D logical names of the colors, their color and $rgb$ values.

%D This text was published in the \MAPS\ of the dutch \TEX\
%D users group \NTG. In that article, the verbatim part of the
%D text was set with the following commands for the examples:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\starttypen% We simplify the \ConTeXt\ macro.
%D   {\bgroup
%D    \everypar{} % We disable some troublesome mechanisms.
%D    \advance\leftskip by 1em
%D    \processdisplayverbatim{\stoptypen}}
%D
%D \def\stoptypen%
%D   {\egroup}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D The implementation itself was typeset with:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \def\startdefinition%
%D   {\bgroup
%D    \everypar{} % Again we disable some troublesome mechanisms.
%D    \let\obeycharacters=\setupprettytextype
%D    \EveryPar{\showparagraphcounter}%
%D    \EveryLine{\showlinecounter}%
%D    \verbatimcorps
%D    \processdisplayverbatim{\stopdefinition}}
%D
%D \def\stopdefinition%
%D   {\egroup}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D And because we have both \type{\EveryPar} and
%D \type{\EveryLine} available, we can implement a dual
%D numbering mechanism:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \newcount\paragraphcounter
%D \newcount\linecounter
%D
%D \def\showparagraphcounter%
%D   {\llap
%D      {\bgroup
%D       \counterfont
%D       \hbox to 4em
%D         {\global\advance\paragraphcounter by 1
%D          \hss \the\paragraphcounter \hskip2em}%
%D       \egroup
%D       \hskip1em}}
%D
%D \def\showlinecounter%
%D   {\llap
%D      {\bgroup
%D       \counterfont
%D       \hbox to 2em
%D         {\global\advance\linecounter by 1
%D          \hss \the\linecounter}%
%D       \egroup
%D       \hskip1em}}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D One may have noticed that the \type{\EveryPar} is only
%D executed once, because we consider each piece of verbatim
%D as one paragraph. When one wants to take the empty lines
%D into account, the following assignments are appropriate:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \EveryLine
%D   {\iflinepar
%D      \showparagraphcounter
%D    \fi
%D    \showlinecounter}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D In this case, nothing has to be assigned to \type{\EveryPar},
%D maybe except of just another extra numbering scheme. The
%D macros used to typeset this documentation are a bit more
%D complicated, because we have to take take 'long' margin
%D lists into account. When such a list exceeds the previous
%D pargraph we postpone placement of the paragraph number till
%D there's room. This way so it does not clash with the margin
%D words.

%D Normally such commands have to be embedded in a decent setup
%D structure, where options can be set at will.
%D
%D Now let's summarize the most important commands.
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \processinlineverbatim{\closingcommand}
%D \processdisplayverbatim{\closingcommand}
%D \processfileverbatim{filename}
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D We can satisfy our own specific needs with the following
%D interfacing macro's:
%D
%D \starttypen

%D Some needs are fulfilled already with:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \setcontrolspace  \settabskips  \setupprettytextype
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D lines can be enhanced with ornaments using:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \everypar  \everyline  \iflinepar
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D and color support is implemented by:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \texbeginofpretty[#1] ... \texendofpretty
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D We can influence the verbatim environment with the following
%D macro and booleans:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \obeyemptylines  \splittexparameters...  \splittexcontrols...
%D \stoptypen
%D
%D The color support macro can be redefined by the user. The
%D parameter \type{#1} can be one of the four 'fixed'
%D identifiers {\em texprettyone}, {\em texprettytwo}, {\em
%D texprettythree} and {\em texprettyfour}. We have implemented a
%D more or less general PostScript color support mechanism,
%D using \type{specials}. One can toggle between color and
%D grayscale with:
%D
%D \starttypen
%D \setgrayverbatim  \setcolorverbatim
%D \stoptypen

%D \macros
%D   {permitshiftedendofverbatim}
%D   {}
%D
%D We did not mention one drawback of the mechanism described
%D here. The closing command must start at the first position
%D of the line. In \CONTEXT\ we will not have this drawback,
%D because we can test if the end command is a substring of the
%D current line. The testing is done by two of the support
%D macros, which of course are not available in a stand alone
%D application of this module.
