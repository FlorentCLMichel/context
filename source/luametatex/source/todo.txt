documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code will be stepwise cleaned up a it (removing the web2c side effects),
making the many branches stand out etc so that some aspects can be documented
a bit better (in due time).

libdeflate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As experiment we provide an interface to libdeflate. This library (in principle)
has:

-- much faster decompression
-- slower compression on relative small data blobs (few k, like context.mkiv)
-- faster compression on huge blobs (char-def.lua)

It is more or less ok to use in:

-- unzipping files
-- decompressing pdf object

where we know the size but it would be handy if the library could reallocate
the target stream because now we need to allocate way too much. In practice we
don't measure much difference but the library is definitely cleaner. There are
probably some compiler options that need to be set, which will happen when

-- there is support for streaming (then zlib will go away)
-- there os a proper cmake file in the source tree

reboot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll experiment with a reboot engine option but for sure that also interferes
with a macro package initialization so it's a long term experiment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
whatever

-- tokenlist_to_cstring: use buffer instead of malloc every time
