PREAMBLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LuaMetaTeX program is a light weight variant of LuaTeX. This program finds its origin
in parts of

- pdfTeX, which is an extension to TeX and eTeX
- aleph, which is a stable variant of omega, which is an extension to tex

So, basically we have as mix of TeX, eTeX, pdfTeX and aleph. The actual starting point (in
2005) was a special Lua enhanced version of pdfTeX by Hartmut Henkel that we experimented
with and triggered a follow up. However, the code base is no longer pascal (which then gets
converted to c) but regular c code instead. That conversion was done by Taco Hoekwater as
part of the Oriental TeX project.

There are many articles (presentations and documents) that discuss the development history.
These articles and documents describing the projects shed more light on what functionality
showed up when and why. As these projects closely relate to ConTeXt development you can
find those documents in the ConTeXt distribution.

After this conversion quite some implementation details changed over the decade that
followed: memory management was adapted, string handling became dynamic, managing the
table of equivalents was tuned to the mix, callbacks were added. The opening up resulted in
some adaption of the internals too. Font handling changed, math support for opentype math
has been introduced. Hyphenation handling, ligature building and kerning are clearly
separated and language support has been rewritten from scratch. In addition to Lua, the
TeX engine is also complemented by the MetaPost library. Luigi Scarso added support for
LuaJIT and ffi and over time makes sure that the code works out okay in the regular
TeXLive build too.

In 2018-2019 the initial conversion from LuaTeX to LuaMetaTeX was done by Hans Hagen as
part of an attempt to simplify the build and get rid of code that might have been useful
when we started but no longer makes sense. Because the LuaTeX interfaces had to stabelize,
this follow up also provides us a new testbed. The LuaMetaTeX source code is distributed
as part of the ConTeXt distribution which is also used for testing and development.

members contribute to the code, we stick to this description. The --credits option
provides more information:

EXCUSE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although some code comes from pdfTeX and Aleph, the majority comes from good old TeX and
eTeX or is completely new. Original TeX is a well documented program written in WEB and
those building upon it have added comments. In LuaMetaTeX we use plain C files but the
comments are still mostly present. When you read them you really need to keep in mind that
some refer to good old TeX! The nice comments come from Don Knuth, the bad and fuzzy ones
originate at us. We appologize to Don for this.

The LuaTeX team is Hans Hagen, Hartmut Henkel, Taco Hoekwater, Luigi Scarso.

LuaMetaTeX builds upon the code from:

    tex        : Donald Knuth
    etex       : Peter Breitenlohner, Phil Taylor and friends

The expansion and protrusion code is derived from:

    pdftex     : Han The Thanh and friends

Much of the bidirectional text flow model is taken from:

    omega      : John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous
    aleph      : Giuseppe Bilotta

Graphic support is provided by:

    metapost   : John Hobby, Taco Hoekwater, Luigi Scarso, Hans Hagen and friends

All this is opened up with:

    lua        : Roberto Ierusalimschy, Waldemar Celes and Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo
    lpeg       : Roberto Ierusalimschy

A few libraries are embedded, of which we mention:

    ffi        : James R. McKaskill
    libdeflate : Eric Biggers (experimental)
    libcerf    : Joachim Wuttke (experimental)
    pplib      : Pawe≈Ç Jackowski (with partial code from libraries)
    md5        : Peter Deutsch (with partial code from pplib libraries)
    sha2       : Aaron D. Gifford (with partial code from pplib libraries)
    socket     : Diego Nehab (partial and adapted)
    zlib       : Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler Tiago Dionizio

The code base contains more names and references. The zlib library might be replaced once
libdeflate provides support for streams. Some libraries are partially adapted. We use an
adapted version of the lfs from the Kepler Project.
