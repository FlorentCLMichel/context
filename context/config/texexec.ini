% == introduction == 
%
% This is 'texexec.ini', the file used by texexec to determine where 
% to find files, what TeX to use, what flags to pass, etc. Although 
% TeXexec tries to locate things itself, a little help is sometimes 
% needed. One can influence texexec by setting some variables. These 
% are only needed when the automatic determined settings fail.

% These are the settings used on some machines at PRAGMA ADE that 
% don't use the texmf tree. They can serve as an example for local 
% settings. Local settings should either be added to the previous 
% one, or go without the 'for' directives. Consider these 
% settings as an example. 

for  private  set  UsedInterfaces  to  en nl
for  private  set  UserInterface   to  nl

% == read this too == 
%
% If this file is called 'texexec.rme', copy it to 'texexec.ini', 
% check the settings above, change them according to your TeX
% distribution, and say: 
%
%   texexec  --verbose
% 
% When set up properly, you should see your local settings fly by. 
% When these settings are ok, the next call should work: 
%
%   texexec  --make
%
% and you should be able to process a file by saying
%
%   texexec  filename
%
% See 'mtexexec.pdf' for more information on the flags you can use with
% 'texexec'. Also make sure you have the 'texutil' script installed in 
% the same path as 'texexec'.
