\startchapter[title={Introduction}]

This is the eights wrapup of the \LUATEX\ and \LUAMETATEX\ development cycle. The
last one was ontarget and focussed on what we did when the engine got mature.
This time we zoom in on developments that go a bit beyond what we originally
planned. One can argue that for instance some of the math extensions should have
ended up here but for us a turning point was when additional par passes became
stable, which was around the time of the 2024 \CONTEXT\ meeting. We'll see what
comes after that.

Most of the chapters in this document were first published in \TUGBOAT, in which
case we have a (year or so) delay in including it here; just become a \TUG\
member if you want it sooner. We therefore want to explicitly mention that Karl
Berry did an amazing job on copy-editing and getting it production ready in a way
that we can still feed back fixes to the text. He not only improves the English
but also catches glitches in our explanations. It just got better. Thanks Karl!
