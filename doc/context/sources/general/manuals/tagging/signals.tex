\startsection[title=The rationale]

On the average a \TEX\ run is pretty fast. On a 2018 laptop processing the 650
page \LUAMETATEX\ manual takes some 15 seconds per run and a \LUAMETAFUN\ manual
demands a similar amount of time once the ridiculous large contour graphics are
cached and that manual is not representative anyway. Mikael can process a 300 plus
page math book in under 10 seconds on his equally old chromebook, and his shiny
new 2025 one needs some 7 seconds. When my colleague processes colorful
educational math books from (many small) \XML\ files and fancy makeup with images
all over the place, it makes little sense to get a coffee while waiting for the
run to finish because even complex runs seldom need more than a minute; it
depends on the number of runs needed.

Processing the more than 2000 files in the test suite takes 750 seconds with the
parallel runner option enabled. A hardware upgrade (or using a desktop machine)
might speed that up but even then I'm not going to stare at the screen for
minutes. Seeing a summary is good enough. So there one has to wait in order to
identify potential issues. Normally that run happens in the background which
brings the danger of forgetting to check the final error report. Ideally that
suite should runs without issues before we update.

Often, running a large job in the background can make sense so how then to keep
track of potential issues and progress? While preparing a talk for Bacho\TEX\
2025 we played with color lamps as part of a presentation where colors and
turning lights on and off was determined by file on display: flagged \PDF. That
made us wonder if we can also use such visual clues for the run state and
therefore \CONTEXT\ signals saw the light!

At Bacho\TEX\ it was decided to follow up on this at the \CONTEXT\ meeting, this
time with a more practical approach than a \ZIGBEE\ setup: a dedicated device
connected to the \USB\ port. Actually, in the end that one also was made to proxy
to a \ZIGBEE\ hub so we got the best of two worlds.

In the following sections we describe the various possibilities: the original
approach of using \ZIGBEE\ devices, and the more practical follow up using a
small device, nicknamed \SQUID.

% Some squids communicate in colors and when I pondered IOT becoming COT it struck
% me that Children Of Time (by Adrian T) also has these initials and squids play a
% role in that one. So, who knows, we might come up with a spider too.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The states]

The idea is that we keep track of the state that \CONTEXT\ is in when processing
a document. We distinguish (at least) these scenarios:

\startitemize
\startitem
    Most users only encounter a normal \CONTEXT\ run. A newly created or heavily
    redacted document often takes a few runs to get all cross references, lists
    and various multi-pass data right. Small changes then need one or two runs.
    If we need more than nine runs we have a problem, and when the run fails we
    have an error.
\stopitem
\startitem
    We ship a test suite that has thousands of files that also demonstrates some
    features. Processing that suite takes some time and for that reason the \type
    {mtx-testsuite} runner can run 8 jobs in parallel. At the end we get a report
    file mentioning the problematic files.
\stopitem
\startitem
    Creating a distribution involves collecting files, running some scripts that
    generate manuals, zipping up files, creating installers, etc. In that
    perspective it is nice to get some feedback if a step fails.
\stopitem
\startitem
    When processing multiple files the \type {--parallel} option can be of help.
    This is basically a collection of regular runs but some indication of
    progress and results is nice.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

When it comes to problems, these can get unnoticed, for instance unknown
references, missing files, absent images, overfull boxes. Future versions of
signals will deal with that too. An error is more dramatic because when a \PDF\
file is written and an error occurs, we en dup with an invalid file. For that
reason \CONTEXT\ produces an error document. But still, some additional feedback
doesn't hurt.

The \ZIGBEE\ approach, the one we started with, introduces a color feedback
palette but the same colors are used in the \SQUID\ as well. Tracking the
scenarios mentioned here are implemented using the same palette:

\starttabulate[|l|l|l|p|]
\NC \SignalBusy     \NC busy     \NC blue   \NC the file is being processed \NC \NR
\NC \SignalDone     \NC done     \NC yellow \NC processing (of an intermediate run) has finished \NC \NR
\NC \SignalFinished \NC finished \NC green  \NC everything is fine after the last run \NC \NR
\NC \SignalProblem  \NC problem  \NC orange \NC something is wrong (like maxnofruns) \NC \NC \NR
\NC \SignalError    \NC error    \NC red    \NC we ended with an error \NC \NR
\stoptabulate

The \type {reset} state turns off all the lamps. When we need more than four runs
the last lamp is reused. When we do a normal \CONTEXT\ run we start out with lamp
one being \SignalBusy. When finished without issues that lamps turns \SignalDone\
and the next one goes \SignalBusy\ and so on. When we have an error the current
lamp goes red and normally \CONTEXT\ has quit. When we need more than the maximum
number of configured runs nine by default, the last lamp is \SignalProblem. When
all are fine within this constraint we have \SignalFinished\ lamps. \footnote {In
the experimental setup \SignalFinished\ and \SignalDone\ were swapped.} There are
ways to configure a different color palette for those who are color blind but
that is still evolving.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=A \ZIGBEE\ setup]

It all started with a \ZIGBEE\ based setup, a low power mesh network with devices
like lamps, switches, sensors and whatever. For signaling the state of a run I
used four \HUE\ color lamps that came into my possession but for which I never
had a purpose. However, any amount of lamps will do. Actually, I ended up with a
single portable lamp so that I can keep track of the state of a run away from the
machine it runs on.

\startnarrower \small
For the record, already for ages I use the warm white \HUE\ bulbs combined with
motion detectors and switches in the office rooms and living spaces. For that we
employ two hubs for communication but for performance reasons we always ran our
own controller script, written in \LUA\ using \LUATEX\ as \LUA\ engine as it has
socket support and can communicate \HTTP. That way we got around the limitations
of that time: the hubs have a low performance and couldn't handle multiple
sensors per room. In fact we could handle more devices than officially supported.
\footnote {In a similar fashion we abuse \LUATEX\ plus script to control a 12
zone \EVOHOME\ heating setup, again to get around limitations. So, here the long
term stability of \LUATEX\ combined with a relative rich set of libraries that
come with \CONTEXT\ pays off.}
\stopnarrower

Announced changes in the \HUE\ \API\ and accessibility of those hubs plus the
fact that one has to be online when initializing a hub made me look at some
fallback solution, just in case. Already for a while, I had a few \PHOSCOM\
\CONBEE\ sticks in stock and I decided hat this was a good moment to play with
them. Such a \USB\ stick plugs into the laptop that I use and thereby is
independent on the \HUE\ hub which actually improves performance: a state switch
takes some 25 milliseconds. Of course there is still some management software
idling in the background which is sub-optimal. So, to summarize this last setup,
we have a \USB\ communication hub, plugged into a computer that runs the related
management software, which comes with a web interface for registering devices. We
connect (in our case) four lights and in order to be able to turn lights off
independently I registered two buttons.

\startnarrower \small
Although the \PHILIPS\ \HUE\ lamps don't come cheap, they are of good quality.
After testing with the E27 lamps we decided to get a few (well built) Go Portable
Lights and these also work well as state lights. The build quality is better than
similar portable \ZIGBEE\ devices.
\stopnarrower

In the end a regular \HUE\ setup was more practical. For testing I used an old
FritzBox \WIFI\ router to which I connected a \HUE\ hub. A disadvantage is that
one needs to be on that network so eventually it's best to be on the usual \WIFI\
router and use a \HUE\ hub on that instead. Later we will see how the \SQUID\ can
avoid this dilemma.

\startnarrower \small
We tried to use cheap Ikea switches but they tend to disappear or drain batteries
when a \CONBEE\ stick is not active. It should be possible to use their devices
but the \HUE\ hardware bulbs and switches are of good quality so why bother. In
the experimental setup the larger bulbs were hidden in opal white glass balls and
were sitting next to the 65 inch monitor that I used (@ 3 meter distance); one
quickly gets accustomed to this!
\stopnarrower

After using the the test setup at \BACHOTEX\ with a dedicated wireless network
and \ZIGBEE\ hub(s) we decided to follow up with a dedicated device connected to
the \USB\ port. This was in the end more reasonable than using \WIFI\ because
client can be isolated from each other and thereby a \WIFI\ controlled approach
is fragile. The device actually can be set up to respond to \WIFI\ signals but
that is mostly an experiment. Less experimental is the ability to act as proxy to
a \HUE\ hub in parallel to running in circles (\SQUID), which we will discuss in
the next section. The main hurdles in a serial connection are figuring out what
port to configure and making sure (on \LINUX) that the user can access the port.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The \SQUID]

We have now arrived at the alternative: a \USB\ connected device. We have a set
of addressable leds, for instance a circle with 24 so called WS2812B leds or a
rectangle with 10 times 16 leds (or more likely: 8 times 12). These are what we
call device 1 and device 2 \SQUID. The reference is device 1, the one that was
introduced at the \CONTEXT\ 2025 meeting. The original idea was to use a
\RASPBERRYPICO, where we experimented with a regular (large) led strip, and we
still support that, but after experimenting and deciding what to produce as
gadget we settled for an ESP32S3. In the end we will support both platforms but
testing now moved to the ESP. The distribution will have the relevant files.
Where we first used the Arduino IDE we now use the vscode platformio system.
Actually the IDE works a bit better but because we wanted to be able to use both
the files were split up and then the io variant is a bit more convenient, also
because it compiles more efficient (faster).

Assuming a device 1 (the gadget with 24 leds in a ring), we have one (squid),
four (quadrant) or eight (segment) visualizers where each represents a run.
Future versions will also explore two (duplex) and six (sexy) modes. By default
context limits the number of runs to nine so the last quadrant or segment is
reused. In practice one never has that many runs, as it indicates some form of
oscillation.

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-001]
\stoplinecorrection

We use \SignalBusy\ when we run and \SignalDone\ when a run ends. When we're done
running we have \SignalFinished\ when all went right, \SignalError\ when there
was an error and \SignalProblem\ when we ran out of runs.

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-002]
\stoplinecorrection

An error normally happens in the first run unless multi-pass data is involved but
even then successive runs might often fail in the first run (segment).

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-003]
\stoplinecorrection

A problem normally shows after all segments are in use. However, in the future we
might use the problem signal for more purposes.

Segments are also used when we trace parallel runs. In that case each segment
is bound to a process handler and within that the \SignalBusy\ signal cycles over the
segment. When there are many runs all segments show \SignalDone\ with
active handlers showing a \SignalBusy. When there is an error, the \SignalDone\
becomes \SignalError\ and when all processes are finished we either have
\SignalFinished\ or \SignalError.

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-004]
\stoplinecorrection

The segments shows above are combined into one as shown below. We use this
feature when we process the test suite which has thousands of files but any
\type {--parallel} driven run use this feature.

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-005]
\stoplinecorrection

We can also run in so called squid mode. Here we have one segment spanning the
whole circle where the \SignalBusy\ is bound to the current page. We use this
when we have documents with hundreds or even thousands of pages. In that case the
signal will run around the circle. You might see a pause or slowdown depending on
what happens on a page.

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-006]
\stoplinecorrection

Quadrants are larger segments and often nicer when the number of runs is limited.
Again we use \SignalBusy\ and \SignalDone\ to show progress while the final
result is reported with \SignalFinished\ when we succeed, \SignalProblem\ when we
need more runs or \SignalError\ when something went wrong.

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-007]
\stoplinecorrection

Quadrants differ from segments in that they show more details about the current
run: within a segment we trace pages as we do with squids. Of course the
granularity is limited because a squid has 24 leds and a quadrant only 6. Anyway,
detail comes at the price of a little more runtime.

For the curious: a device 2 uses a rectangular setup and therefore can also show
(single) characters in Knuths 36 font. This is more of a a playground.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The software]

So how is this controlled? Triggering signal events is done with either the \type
{context} script or with \type {mtxrun}:

\starttyping
context --signal=runner ...
mtxrun --script signal ...
\stoptyping

Of course the \type {runner} signal has to be enabled and later we will show how
that is done. You can also add a directive at the top of your document:

\starttyping[option=TEX]
% signal=runner
\stoptyping

When you use a \SQUID\ the communication with the device goes via the serial (\USB)
interface using simple command sequences to limit the overhead. We started out with
the quadrants and later added segments (for more granularity) and squids (single
but with page details) and in the end the (for the user) hidden interfaces became
rather similar. In this case you can use these directives:

\starttyping[option=TEX]
% signal=squid
% signal=segment
% signal=quadrant
\stoptyping

When you use a \SQUID\ the \type {runner} directive is equivalent to the \type
{segment} one. What actually happens also depends on the configuration file. Just
in case one wonders about lights, sound is another option as are messages to ones
phone but we avoid being too fancy.

At \BACHOTEX\ we introduced a
compromise: \QRCODE. There is no status information then but an error will
create a \PDF\ file with a \QRCODE:

\starttyping[option=TEX]
% signal=qr
\stoptyping

The configuration file can look a bit intimidating but if you only use the
\SQUID\ some entries can be omitted. Here is an example of such a file (it kind
of evolves so it might change a bit at some point):

\starttyping[option=LUA]
return {
    servers = {
        squid = {
            protocol = "serial",
            port     = "COM6",
            baud     = 115200,
        },
        -- optional, not needed when device is used
        conbee = {
            protocol = "deconz",
            token    = "XXXXXXXXXX",
            url      = "http://127.0.0.1",
        },
        -- optional, not needed when device is used
        hue = {
            protocol = "hue",
            token    = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            url      = "https://192.168.178.25",
            lamps    = { 2 }, -- default
        },
    },
    signals = {
        runner = {
            enabled = true,
            lamps   = { 1 },
        },
        squid = {
            enabled = true,
            lamps   = { 1 },
        },
        quadrant = {
            enabled = true,
            lamps   = { 1, 2 },
        },
        segment = {
            enabled = true,
            lamps   = { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
        },
    },
    usage = {
        enabled = true,
        server = "squid",
    },
    version = 1.001,
    comment = "signal setup file",
}
\stoptyping

This file has to be someplace where it can be found by \CONTEXT\ and its scripts,
for instance in \typ {TEXMF-LOCAL/tex/context/user/mkxl}. You can make an empty
one with:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --create
\stoptyping

Successive runs will check for the presence of that file and use it when found.
Otherwise the current directory is used to save the new configuration, so you'd
best move it to where it belongs.

Servers are configured with (for instance):

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --servers \
    --protocol=serial --port=... squid
mtxrun --script signal --servers \
    --protocol=hue --url=... --token=... hue
mtxrun --script signal --servers \
    --protocol=deconz --url=... --token=... conbee
\stoptyping

and enabled with:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --usage squid
\stoptyping

The various signals are set up with:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --signals --lamps=1,2,3 runner
mtxrun --script signal --signals --lamps=1     runner
mtxrun --script signal --signals --lamps=-4    runner
\stoptyping

Positive values indicate (color) lights, negative values indicate plugs that only
support on/off states. A specific signal has to be enabled:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --enable runner
\stoptyping

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The prerequisites]

This section is only relevant iF you use \ZIGBEE\ without a \SQUID. The \SQUID\
can be configured to also control \HUE\ lamps for which it has to be connected to
the relevant \WIFI\ network.

The signal \ZIGBEE\ handler assumes that curl is installed, the binary and/or
library. We also need a \ZIGBEE\ gateway, like \HUE\ or \CONBEE\ (that last one
needs the \PHOSCOM\ app \DECONZ\ has to be run). In the case of a \HUE\ system
the hub should be on the same network. You need to configure lights and then
register these as shown above. In order to access the \ZIGBEE\ interfaces you
need to get a token. For instance in \DECONZ:

\starttyping
curl -X POST -i "http://127.0.0.1/api" \
    --data "{ \"devicetype\" : \"password\" }"
\stoptyping

For \HUE\ you need something like this (first hit the button on the hub):

\starttyping
curl -X POST -k -i https://192.168.178.25/debug/clip.html \
    --data "{\"devicetype\":\"service-name#username\"}"
\stoptyping

In the future I might add some more protocols, for instance FritzBox also
supports \ZIGBEE\ now\ but I can't test that right now.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The interface]

There are a few interfaces that one can use to construct dedicated state
reporting, as we do for the test suite and distribution. For running \CONTEXT\
there are also various predefined setups. So, normally a user can just rely on
what we provide out of the box. It is however good to realize that there are two
fundamentally different usage patterns:

\startitemize

\startitem
    The runner and segment signals are controlled by the \type {context} script. This
    means that the overhead is minimal and that the run itself is not aware of
    it being signaled.
\stopitem

\startitem
    The squid and quadrant signals show progress per page and for that the run
    itself needs to provide information. Here the \type {context} script
    initializes the \SQUID\ and the \CONTEXT\ run then updates the state. This
    brings a bit of extra overhead but it's probably worth it.
\stopitem

\stopitemize

So, when you process a file in the usual way, the runner will act upon the return
state of a \TEX\ run. Because the runner knows how often it has ran and when it's
finished, either or not successful, it can manage the initial and final signals
best and also knows when to proceed to a next segment or quadrant. Below we show some
ways to control signaling but keep in mind that normally all happens automatically
in the most efficient way possible.

Here we just give a simple example so that you get an idea what happens behind
the screens. The slow way is to call the runner, like:

\starttyping[option=LUA]
os.execute("mtxrun --script signal --state=reset runner")
\stoptyping

But you can also use this pattern, assuming that you run \CONTEXT\ or use a \LUA\
file with \typ {mtxrun --script somename.lua}.

\starttyping[option=LUA]
local signal   = utilities.signals.initialize("runner")
local enabled  = type(signal) == "function"

if enabled then
    signal("reset")
end

-- code that sets 'okay'

if enabled then
    if okay then
        signal("done",1)
    else
        signal("error",1)
    end
end
\stoptyping

The second argument is the lamp number (or run) and the third argument indicates
that we apply the state to all lamps. The \type {run} and \type {finished} states
always apply to all lamps. In the \type {util-sig-imp-*} files you can see how
the various signals are set up. The differences are subtle. It only makes sense to
study this when you have workflows with special demands. In principle you can
create a setup with multiple squids and create visual feedback as you wish.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The \CURL\ library]

If you use the \SQUID\ you can forget about this section but otherwise we assume
that the \CURL\ library \type {libcurl.so} or \type {libcurl.dll} is present,
preferable in the \TEX\ tree under \typ {bin/luametatex/lib/curl}. If that one
can't be loaded the program will be used instead. We could fall back on the
built-in socket library but we have to assume that servers use \type {https}.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The runner]

We have two scripts, the original runner related script (signal) and one for the
device (squid, quadrant and segment). The runner script can be used to control
lights. Here are a few examples. This will turn off the lights:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --reset
\stoptyping

Here you get some information about the current setup:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --info
\stoptyping

A state can be set with:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal --state=busy         runner
mtxrun --script signal --state=busy --run=2 runner
mtxrun --script signal --state=busy --all   runner
\stoptyping

Help information is available with:

\starttyping
mtxrun --script signal
\stoptyping

Remark: the \type {--prune} and \type {--wipe} options are only for testing as
they mess with rules. Turning off a lamp can be done with \type {--reset} anyway.

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The \SQUID\ hardware]

A \SQUID\ is basically a small controller like a \RASPBERRYPICO\ connected to a
series of leds. The software is written in the \ARDUINO\ editor and uses related
libraries. You can just compile it for any similar device in which case you need
to configure the right \IO\ pins. It's a relatively simple setup. With (2025) led
rings and controllers being cheap you can in principle make a \SQUID\ for less
than 15 euro but you might want to spice it a bit with a switch. We run the leds
at low brightness so there is no need for additional power.

(todo: reference to design document and some photos)

\stopsection

\startsection[title=The serial interface]

The serial interface uses simple command sequences: the first character tells
what we want to do, the second character is a specifier within that category.
Follow up characters are data, like a specific action (busy, done, etc.)
optionally followed by a number (segment, quadrant, etc.), or some configuration
number or string. In all cases ending with a return \type {\n} avoids getting out
of sync due to look ahead confusion.

We can set all leds with the \type {a} command. The other commands can do the
same but here a step is equivalent to busy.

\starttabulate [|T|p|]
\FL
\NC a [i r]       \NC reset (also initializes counter) \NC \NR
\NC a s           \NC step (busy)                      \NC \NR
\NC a [d f p e r] \NC set state                        \NC \NR
\LL
\stoptabulate

Segments are controlled with:

\starttabulate [|T|p|]
\FL
\NC s [i r]       [0 1..8] \NC reset (also initializes counter) \NC \NR
\NC s s           [0 1..8] \NC step (increments)                \NC \NR
\NC s [d f p e r] [0 1..8] \NC set state                        \NC \NR
\LL
\stoptabulate

Quadrants are controlled with:

\starttabulate [|T|p|]

Single led squids are controlled with:

When configured, \HUE\ bulbs can be turned on and off by:

\starttabulate [|T|p|]

It's possible to reset the lot:

\starttabulate [|T|p|]
\FL
\NC r \NC reset \NC \NR

We don't go into detail about this but there's also direct control of leds:

\starttabulate [|T|p|]
\FL
\NC d <n> r g b \NC set led directly by four byte values \NC \NR
\LL
\stoptabulate

Here is a variant of this (no comment as it's experimental too):

\starttabulate [|T|p|]
\FL
\NC i <n> r g b \NC set individual led by four byte values \NC \NR
\LL
\stoptabulate

The device is set up with the next set of commands. The configuration can be
saved on the device itself. At some point we will add an option to configure
using the configuration file.

If you have a device 2, there's also a text option, where the character set is
limited to the repertoire in Knuths 36 font. This is more for myself to play
with. You can also send text (string) via the signal script.

The device itself has a simple way to set up some properties. Here the two
buttons come into play. The left button by default will turn off the leds. The
state is remembered so hitting that button again will show the last remembered
state.

The right button initiates configuration mode. That right button is that used to
jump from option to option. The last option is colored red which indicates that
we reached the exit option, and hitting the left button gets us out of
configuration mode. In fact, the left button is confirmation for the other
options as well.

\starttabulate[|||]
\NC palette  \NC choose a different color palette (color blind related) \NC \NR
\NC preroll  \NC show the startup led test sequence \NC \NR
\NC dimming  \NC dim the leds, start bright when out of levels \NC \NR
\NC defaults \NC set the default configuration \NC \NR
\NC logo     \NC show a couple of \quote {characters} \NC \NR
\NC restart  \NC restart the device \NC \NR
\NC save     \NC save the settings in flash memory \NC \NR
\NC exit     \NC exit the configuration \NC \NR
\stoptabulate

So, when you hit the right button, the top led will be green and represent the
\type {palette} option, when the button is hit again, the third led lights up and
represents the \type {preroll}; we use the odd numbered leds. The text option is
a gimmick and shows in sequence:

\startlinecorrection
    \getbuffer[squid-010]
\stoplinecorrection

\startsection[title=Connecting]

On \MSWINDOWS\ you can plug in a serial (usb) cable and the device gets a port
assigned. Normally you get the same port. You can check the right name (something
\type {COM:}) in the device manager, so for example \type {COM6:}.

In \LINUX\ the device will normally be \type {/dev/ttyACM0} but there we also
need to make sure that we get access. You need to be a member of the \type
{dialout} group, which can be done with \typ {sudo usermod -a -G dialout
yourname} (you need to re-login).

When you connect the device visa for instance a \USB\ hub in a keyboard you
should expect uncomfortable delays, at least that is what I encountered on the
\LINUX\ box.

The software on the device will be part of the \CONTEXT\ distribution and updates
are to be expected.
